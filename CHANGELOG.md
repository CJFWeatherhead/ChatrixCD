  - URLs like `https://chat.example.org/_matrix/client/v3/login/sso/redirect/oidc?redirectUrl=http://localhost:8080/callback` no longer cause crashes
  - Fixes issue where app would crash with MarkupError during OIDC authentication flow in TUI mode
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed OIDC authentication hanging when running with TUI (default interactive mode)
  - Issue #59 recurrence: The code was trying to push OIDC screen to TUI before TUI was started

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed OIDC authentication hanging when attempting to parse identity providers from server response
  - The code was attempting to re-read an already consumed aiohttp response body, causing the authentication flow to hang
  - Now makes a fresh HTTP request to `/_matrix/client/v3/login` to obtain identity provider information
  - Fixes authentication with OIDC-enabled Matrix servers (e.g., chat.privacyinternational.org)
  - Falls back gracefully to generic SSO URL if identity provider fetch fails

### Added

  - Press 'q' or ESC to exit the configuration viewer
- Comprehensive error handling to prevent stacktraces in production
  - Unhandled exceptions in TUI and main application are now caught and displayed as user-friendly messages
  - Stacktraces are only shown when running with `-v`, `-vv`, or `-vvv` flags (debug mode)
  - Users are prompted to run with `-v` or `-vv` for more details when errors occur

### Improved

  - Logs callback invocation and token retrieval steps
  - Helps diagnose authentication issues when running with `-vv` or `-vvv` flags

- `-s` / `--show-config` flag to display current configuration with redacted credentials
- `-a` / `--admin` option for specifying admin users on command line (can be used multiple times)
- `-r` / `--room` option for specifying allowed rooms on command line (can be used multiple times)
- Configuration overrides via command-line arguments
- Comprehensive tests for CLI argument parsing

#### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow for running unit tests on pull requests
- GitHub Actions workflow for creating releases with calendar versioning
- Automated version bumping in `__init__.py` and `setup.py`
- Automated changelog generation from git commits
- Automated GitHub releases with changelog

### Improved
- **Configuration Error Handling**: Added graceful handling of malformed JSON configuration files
  - Clear error messages showing filename, line number, and column where error occurred
  - Detailed problem description for JSON parsing errors
  - Proper error messages for file permission issues
  - Bot exits with status code 1 on configuration errors instead of crashing with stack trace

### Fixed

#### Encrypted Rooms
- Bot now properly handles encrypted messages by requesting decryption keys when needed
- Added MegolmEvent callback to automatically request room keys for encrypted messages that couldn't be decrypted
- Bot will now respond to commands in encrypted rooms once encryption keys are received

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-08

### Added

#### Core Features
- Matrix bot implementation using matrix-nio
- End-to-end encryption support for Matrix rooms

#### Key Implementation Details

**OIDC Authentication Flow**:
1. Discover OIDC endpoints from issuer
2. Use client credentials grant to obtain token
3. Set token on Matrix client
4. Verify token with sync request
5. Support token refresh when available

**Task Monitoring**:
- Async background task for each running job
- Polls Semaphore API every 10 seconds
- Sends status updates to Matrix room
- Automatically removes completed tasks

**E2E Encryption**:
- Automatic key storage in configurable directory
- Support for encrypted rooms
- Device management via matrix-nio

### Security Considerations
- Credentials stored in configuration files or environment variables
- Access tokens not logged
- Support for restrictive file permissions
- Room and user access controls
- Secure OIDC implementation with HTTPS-only endpoints

### Platform Support
- Linux (tested)
- macOS (should work)
- Windows (should work)
- Docker (Linux containers)

### Known Limitations
- No interactive task parameter input yet
- No task scheduling support
- Single Semaphore instance per bot
- In-memory task tracking (lost on restart)
- No web interface

### Future Plans
- Interactive task configuration
- Task scheduling with cron syntax
- Multi-tenant support
- Webhook support for push notifications
- Rich message formatting
- Task history and analytics
- Admin dashboard
