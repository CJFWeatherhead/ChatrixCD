# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated releases.

## Test Workflow (`test.yml`)

### Trigger Events
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches
- Push to `main` branch

### What it does
1. Checks out the code
2. Sets up Python (versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
3. Installs dependencies
4. Runs all unit tests using `python -m unittest discover`

### How to use
The workflow runs automatically on pull requests and pushes. No manual intervention needed.

## Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

### Trigger Events
- Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch

### What it does
1. **Test Phase**:
   - Runs all unit tests
   - Fails the release if tests fail

2. **Build and Release Phase** (only if tests pass):
   - Calculates the next version using calendar versioning (YYYY.MM.PATCH)
   - Updates version in `chatrixcd/__init__.py` and `setup.py`
   - Generates changelog from git commits since last release
   - Commits version changes
   - Creates and pushes a git tag
   - Creates a GitHub release with the generated changelog

### Version Format
- **Calendar Versioning (CalVer)**: YYYY.MM.PATCH
- Example: `2024.12.0`, `2024.12.1`, `2025.01.0`

### Version Types
- **patch**: Increments the patch number (e.g., 2024.12.0 â†’ 2024.12.1)
- **minor**: Also increments the patch number (provided for semantic clarity)

The patch number resets to 0 when the month changes.

### How to use
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select **Build and Release** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select **version_type** (patch or minor)
5. Click **Run workflow**

### Prerequisites
- All unit tests must pass
- The workflow needs write permissions for contents (already configured)

## Version Calculation Logic

The release workflow automatically determines the next version:

1. Gets the current year and month (e.g., 2024-12)
2. Finds the latest tag for this month (e.g., `2024.12.2`)
3. Increments the patch number (e.g., `2024.12.3`)
4. If no tag exists for the current month, starts with patch 0 or 1 (depending on version type)

## Changelog Generation

The changelog is automatically generated from git commit messages:
- Includes all commits since the last release
- Format: `- <commit message> (<short hash>)`
- Includes a link to the full changelog on GitHub

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages as they will appear in the changelog
2. **Testing**: Always ensure tests pass locally before creating a release
3. **Version Type**: Use "patch" for bug fixes and small changes, "minor" for new features
4. **Frequency**: Create releases regularly to keep the changelog manageable
