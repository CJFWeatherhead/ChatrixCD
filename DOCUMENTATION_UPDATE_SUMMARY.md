## Download Link Format

All documentation uses GitHub's automatic latest release URL pattern:

```

**Key benefit:** These links automatically redirect to the latest non-pre-release version. No manual updates needed when creating new releases!

## Example Download Links

- Linux x86_64: `https://github.com/CJFWeatherhead/ChatrixCD/releases/latest/download/chatrixcd-linux-x86_64`
- Windows x86_64: `https://github.com/CJFWeatherhead/ChatrixCD/releases/latest/download/chatrixcd-windows-x86_64.exe`
- macOS Universal: `https://github.com/CJFWeatherhead/ChatrixCD/releases/latest/download/chatrixcd-macos-universal`
