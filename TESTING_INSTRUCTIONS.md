# Testing Instructions for Build Workflow Fixes

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Action Required

The build workflow fixes have been implemented and committed to the `copilot/build-windows-macos-binary` branch. However, **the workflow must be tested before this PR can be merged**.

The workflow does not automatically run on feature branch pushes. It only triggers on:
1. Pull request merge to `main`
2. Manual workflow dispatch

## How to Test

### Option 1: Manual Workflow Dispatch (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the GitHub Actions tab: https://github.com/CJFWeatherhead/ChatrixCD/actions
2. Click on "Build and Release" workflow in the left sidebar
3. Click the "Run workflow" button (top right)
4. In the dropdown:
   - **Branch:** Select `copilot/build-windows-macos-binary`
   - **Version type:** Select `patch` (or any option)
5. Click "Run workflow" button

This will trigger a full build across all platforms without merging to main.

### Option 2: View in Pull Request

If a PR already exists for this branch, the workflow should run automatically on the PR. Check the PR page for the workflow status.

## What to Verify

Once the workflow runs successfully, verify the following:

### ✅ All Jobs Complete Successfully
- [ ] Run Unit Tests
- [ ] Build Linux x86_64
- [ ] Build Linux i686
- [ ] Build Linux arm64
- [ ] Build Windows x86_64
- [ ] Build macOS Universal
- [ ] Create Release

### ✅ Artifacts Are Generated
Navigate to the workflow run and check the "Artifacts" section at the bottom. You should see:

1. **chatrixcd-linux-x86_64** - Linux 64-bit binary
2. **chatrixcd-linux-i686** - Linux 32-bit binary
3. **chatrixcd-linux-arm64** - Linux ARM 64-bit binary
4. **chatrixcd-windows-x86_64** - Windows .exe file
5. **chatrixcd-macos-universal** - macOS binary and .app bundle

### ✅ Download and Test Artifacts (Optional)

1. Download each artifact from the workflow run
2. Extract the zip files
3. Verify file sizes are reasonable (not 0 bytes)
4. Optionally test execution:

**Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x chatrixcd-linux-x86_64
./chatrixcd-linux-x86_64 --version
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
chatrixcd-windows-x86_64.exe --version
```

**macOS:**
```bash
./chatrixcd-macos-universal --version
# or
open ChatrixCD.app
```

## Expected Results

### Build Times
- **Linux x86_64:** ~5-10 minutes
- **Linux i686:** ~20-25 minutes (Docker build)
- **Linux arm64:** ~25-35 minutes (QEMU emulation)
- **Windows:** ~8-12 minutes
- **macOS:** ~8-12 minutes
- **Total:** ~45-60 minutes for all builds

### Known Working Configurations
All builds should complete with:
- Python 3.12
- Nuitka latest (main branch)
- matrix-nio[e2e] >= 0.24.0 with libolm

## Troubleshooting

### If Windows Build Fails
Check the "Install libolm (Windows)" step logs for:
- Successful cmake build
- Presence of `olm_static.lib` in `C:\olm-install\lib`
- Successful copy to `olm.lib`

### If macOS Build Fails
Check the "Install dependencies" step logs for:
- Successful homebrew installation of libolm, pkg-config, and cmake
- No CMake version compatibility errors

### If ARM64 Build Fails
Check for:
- QEMU setup completed successfully
- Docker Buildx setup completed
- Image pull successful: `arm64v8/python:3.12-slim`
- No "exec format error" in the build step

## Changes Made

See [BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md](BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md) for a complete list of all changes and fixes applied.

## After Successful Test

Once all builds complete successfully:

1. ✅ Mark this PR as ready for review
2. ✅ Request final review from maintainers
3. ✅ Merge to `main` when approved

## Questions?

If the workflow fails or you encounter any issues:
1. Check the workflow logs for specific error messages
2. Compare against the known issues in BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md
3. Review the specific job logs that failed
4. Open an issue with the error details if needed
