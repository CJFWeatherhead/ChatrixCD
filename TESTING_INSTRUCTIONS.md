# Testing Instructions for Build Workflow Fixes

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Action Required

The build workflow fixes have been implemented and committed to the `copilot/build-windows-macos-binary` branch. **The workflow will automatically run when this PR is opened/updated**.

The workflow triggers on:
1. Pull requests to `main` (opens/updates) - **This is how to test before merge**
2. Pull request merge to `main` (for actual release creation)
3. Manual workflow dispatch (from default branch only)

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test via Pull Request (Recommended)

The workflow is configured to run on pull requests to `main`. If a PR exists for this branch:

1. Navigate to the Pull Request page
2. The workflow should run automatically when the PR is opened/updated
3. Check the "Checks" tab at the bottom of the PR to see the workflow status
4. All 7 jobs should complete successfully

**Note:** The workflow runs on the `pull_request` trigger when the PR is opened or updated, but it will only proceed to the "Create Release" step if the PR is actually merged.

### Option 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch (From Main Branch)

The manual workflow dispatch only works from branches where the workflow file exists. To test from the feature branch:

1. First, ensure this PR is created (which you've already done)
2. The workflow will automatically run on the PR
3. Alternatively, you can merge the PR to `main` (after review) and then use workflow dispatch from `main` for future releases

**Important:** GitHub Actions workflow dispatch only shows branches where the workflow file exists. Since this is a feature branch with workflow changes, the PR-based testing is the primary method.

## What to Verify

Once the workflow runs successfully, verify the following:

### ✅ All Jobs Complete Successfully
- [ ] Run Unit Tests
- [ ] Build Linux x86_64
- [ ] Build Linux i686
- [ ] Build Linux arm64
- [ ] Build Windows x86_64
- [ ] Build macOS Universal
- [ ] Create Release

### ✅ Artifacts Are Generated
Navigate to the workflow run and check the "Artifacts" section at the bottom. You should see:

1. **chatrixcd-linux-x86_64** - Linux 64-bit binary
2. **chatrixcd-linux-i686** - Linux 32-bit binary
3. **chatrixcd-linux-arm64** - Linux ARM 64-bit binary
4. **chatrixcd-windows-x86_64** - Windows .exe file
5. **chatrixcd-macos-universal** - macOS binary and .app bundle

### ✅ Download and Test Artifacts (Optional)

1. Download each artifact from the workflow run
2. Extract the zip files
3. Verify file sizes are reasonable (not 0 bytes)
4. Optionally test execution:

**Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x chatrixcd-linux-x86_64
./chatrixcd-linux-x86_64 --version
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
chatrixcd-windows-x86_64.exe --version
```

**macOS:**
```bash
./chatrixcd-macos-universal --version
# or
open ChatrixCD.app
```

## Expected Results

### Build Times
- **Linux x86_64:** ~5-10 minutes
- **Linux i686:** ~20-25 minutes (Docker build)
- **Linux arm64:** ~25-35 minutes (QEMU emulation)
- **Windows:** ~8-12 minutes
- **macOS:** ~8-12 minutes
- **Total:** ~45-60 minutes for all builds

### Known Working Configurations
All builds should complete with:
- Python 3.12
- Nuitka latest (main branch)
- matrix-nio[e2e] >= 0.24.0 with libolm

## Troubleshooting

### If Windows Build Fails
Check the "Install libolm (Windows)" step logs for:
- Successful cmake build
- Presence of `olm_static.lib` in `C:\olm-install\lib`
- Successful copy to `olm.lib`

### If macOS Build Fails
Check the "Install dependencies" step logs for:
- Successful homebrew installation of libolm, pkg-config, and cmake
- No CMake version compatibility errors

### If ARM64 Build Fails
Check for:
- QEMU setup completed successfully
- Docker Buildx setup completed
- Image pull successful: `arm64v8/python:3.12-slim`
- No "exec format error" in the build step

## Changes Made

See [BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md](BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md) for a complete list of all changes and fixes applied.

## After Successful Test

Once all builds complete successfully:

1. ✅ Mark this PR as ready for review
2. ✅ Request final review from maintainers
3. ✅ Merge to `main` when approved

## Questions?

If the workflow fails or you encounter any issues:
1. Check the workflow logs for specific error messages
2. Compare against the known issues in BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md
3. Review the specific job logs that failed
4. Open an issue with the error details if needed
