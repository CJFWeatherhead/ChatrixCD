# AI/LLM Generated Documentation

This directory contains documentation that was generated or heavily influenced by AI/LLM tools during development. These documents serve as context, audit trails, and development notes.

## Purpose

- **Context Documentation**: Implementation plans, migration notes, and architecture decisions
- **Audit Trails**: Records of changes, fixes, and integration work
- **Development Notes**: Test plans, compliance checks, and evaluation documents
- **Non-Critical Documentation**: Documents that support development but are not part of the main user-facing documentation

## Organization

Files in this directory are typically:

- Named with underscores and block capitals (e.g., `ENCRYPTION_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`)
- Generated during feature implementation or problem-solving
- Used for reference and historical context
- Not part of the primary project documentation in `/docs`

## When to Add Files Here

Add documentation to this directory when:

- An AI/LLM generates context or planning documents
- Creating audit trails of significant changes
- Recording implementation details for future reference
- Documenting evaluations, tests, or compliance checks
- The document is for development context rather than end-user documentation

## Main Documentation

For user-facing and critical project documentation, see:

- `/docs` - GitHub Pages documentation (user guides, tutorials)
- `/README.md` - Project overview
- `/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture (in `/docs`)
