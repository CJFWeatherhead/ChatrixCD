## Documentation Guidelines

When updating documentation:

1. **Keep it in sync**: Ensure documentation aligns with the current codebase
2. **Update frontmatter**: Each page should have proper Jekyll frontmatter (layout, title, nav_order)
3. **Use relative links**: Link to other documentation pages using relative paths
4. **Test locally**: Preview changes locally before committing
5. **Update both locations**: Some docs exist in both root (e.g., README.md) and docs/ - keep them synchronized

## Theme Configuration

The site uses the Just the Docs theme configured in `_config.yml`:
- Modern, responsive design
- Built-in search functionality
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
